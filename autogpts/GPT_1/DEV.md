# working test prompt (compacted)
Using OpenAI playground with GPT-3.5-Turbo model

from gpt-3.5-turbo/onotolog-format.j2

## Task (from benchmarks):
Create a three_sum function in python. Given an array of integers, return indices of the three numbers such that they add up to a specific target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. Example: Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 20, Because nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = 2 + 7 + 11 = 20, return [0, 1, 2] 

## Abilities (faked):
- create_file(filename): create a new file with filename
- write_file(filename, text):  you can write a string to a file
- run_python_file(filename): run a python file and return output
- append_file(filename, text): able to append text to a file of filename
- finish(): call when finished task

## Notes 
Added "and previous steps" to instruction sentence, removed plan and changed reasoning to reason. Working while running steps to be more efficient

Will need to add a last steps format that has an output field to give feedback to AI on what next steps will be

## Last Steps format
```json
{
    "last_steps": [
        {
            "ability": "ability name",
            "results": "results from using ability"
        
        }
    ]
}

```
